We also analyse your use of the application, your profile (such as age, gender and place of residence), activities, your posts, interests, as well as your behaviour which allows us to improve the website and/or service.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">We have the right to show you relevant, promoted content from buddies, people or companies you follow. These promoted posts will not be displayed when you stop following the source of the post. We offer this service to allow companies or users to enlarge their organic reach. Vurze will appropriately mark these if and when used.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">We will not include your content in advertisements for the products and services for others to others.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">We also collect general data concerning visitors and therefore process IP addresses, as well as information concerning screen resolution, the browser type and the behaviour of users in Vurze, our website and application.

If you access the website or application through your mobile device we save your IP address (except the last three numbers of the IP address which are removed before the IP address is stored), browser- and device type through Google Analytics (for more information on the Google Analytics cookies used see hereafter). Google Analytics also collects your location data (IP address of your PC or the location coordinates of your device). We also sometimes record (a 10% sample of all users) video of users screen, ONLY within the app, when its open and the screen is on, and not any notifications from third party apps that are visible while the app is open via Appsee. We track crashes, session duration, type of device, OS version, connectivity type, device resolution. Next to Google Analytics we use Mixpanel to anonymously track events connected with UI elements at the individual level.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">5.

We also process your personal data for internal purposes such as ensuring security of the application, Vurze, yourself or others, detect, prevent and combat fraud or other illegal activities, problem solving, testing and improvement of service.
